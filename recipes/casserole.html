        <li>3 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped pecans</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Prepare sweet potatoes: Put sweet potatoes in a medium saucepan and 
            cover with water. Cook over medium-high heat until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. 
            Drain and transfer to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Mash drained sweet potatoes with a fork. Add eggs; mix until well combined. 
            Add sugar, milk, butter, vanilla, and salt; mix until smooth. 
            Transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Make topping: Mix brown sugar and flour together in a medium bowl. 
            Cut in butter with a pastry cutter until mixture is coarse and 
            looks like peas; don't overmix. Stir in pecans. 
            Sprinkle topping over sweet potato mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is lightly browned, about 30 minutes.
